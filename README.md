# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure

This app was inspired by a Halloween theme and my favorite Choose Your Own Adventure books. I thought this theme is suitable for this project because it requires multiple screens that ultimately lead to a unique end result.
I originally designed this app to work using an empty activity for each question for each scenario and using Intent to navigate to the next screen. I found this tedious and complicated and decided to loop through the questions and choices of strings. To make sure the choices lined up correctly with the question, I used a binary tree. I then calculated the left and right children to display the next pair of choices and questions. Each option chosen leads to a unique path in the story.
Day 1: Decide on making choose your own adventure app and start making multiple empty activities
Day 2: add more empty activities
Day 3: added buttons
Day 4: more buttons!
Day 5: starting to make it flow with Intent class
Day 6: stuck on navigation
Day 7: still stuck on navigation
Day 8: condense to one class instead
Day 9: fixed major issues, added background, got the choices to display correctly
